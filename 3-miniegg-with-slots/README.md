Slotted E-Graphs
================

In this repository we've implemented slotted e-graphs.

For a higher level introduction to slotted e-graphs, consider
* the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cg365LVbYg)
* the [pre-print](https://michel.steuwer.info/files/publications/2024/EGRAPHS-2024.pdf)

For an example implementation of a Language with binders in slotted e-graphs, consider the RISE implementation [here](https://github.com/memoryleak47/egraph-sandbox/tree/main/3-miniegg-with-slots/src/i_rise).
